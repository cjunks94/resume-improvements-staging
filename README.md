# Resume Improvement Project

**Target Role**: Senior Software Engineer
**Status**: Active portfolio — continuously updated

## Live Portfolio

**Production**: [cjunker.dev](https://cjunker.dev) - Deployed from `master` branch
**Staging**: [staging.cjunker.dev](https://staging.cjunker.dev) - Deployed to dedicated repository
**Tech Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, SSH Deploy Keys
**Status**: Multi-repository architecture with bulletproof SSL + isolated environments

## Analytics

Analytics temporarily paused. Umami config preserved in `umami/` for future re-enablement. Using Railway built-in metrics in the interim.

## Project Overview

This repository tracks strategic improvements to my software engineering resume and portfolio to target senior-level positions at companies like Datadog. The focus is on demonstrating real, actionable achievements in distributed systems, observability, and cloud-native technologies.

## Objectives

1. **Technical Depth**: Showcase expertise in Go, Kubernetes, event streaming (Kafka/RabbitMQ), and observability tools
2. **Leadership**: Document mentoring, cross-team initiatives, and architectural decisions
3. **Innovation**: Build prototype projects demonstrating forward-thinking (AI/ML, real-time monitoring)
4. **Visibility**: Increase public presence through open-source contributions, blog posts, and technical networking
5. **ATS Optimization**: Align resume keywords and formatting with target job descriptions

## Related Projects

| Project | Description | Repo |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **[go-trading-system](../go-trading-system)** | Real-time stock trading simulation in Go (WebSocket streaming, order matching, P&L tracking) | Separate repo |

## Key Technologies

**Current Expertise**: Ruby/Rails, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis

**Target Additions**: Go, Kafka/RabbitMQ, Prometheus, distributed tracing, AI/ML monitoring

## Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linters
npm lint

# Serve locally
npm run serve
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Deployment

The site uses **multi-repository architecture** with automatic CI/CD:

**Production (cjunker.dev):**
```bash
git checkout master
git push origin master
# → Deploys to cjunks94/resume-improvements gh-pages branch
# → Available at https://cjunker.dev
```

**Staging / PR Previews (staging.cjunker.dev):**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git push origin feature/my-feature
# → Deploys to cjunks94/resume-improvements-staging (external repo)
# → Available at https://staging.cjunker.dev
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ Separate SSL certificates (no more `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`)
- ✅ Clean environment isolation
- ✅ Secure SSH deploy key authentication
- ✅ Industry-standard pattern (used by Stripe, Vercel, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic PR preview deployments
- ✅ Zero history bloat with force_orphan

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Production:** `master` → https://cjunker.dev
- **Staging / PR Previews:** All branches → https://staging.cjunker.dev
- **Manual deploy:** Workflow dispatch with environment selector
- **External staging repo:** Bulletproof SSL + isolation
- **Build time:** ~45s (GitHub hosted)
